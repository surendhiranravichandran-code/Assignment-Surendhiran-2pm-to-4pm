    <h1>Q5:Nest inline elements correctly inside a &lt;p&gt; (bold and italic text).</h1>
    When life <b><i>feels heavy and dreams seem far</i></b>, remember that even the darkest night must end with the <b><i>morning star</i></b>. Every failure you face is not your fall, but a quiet whisper urging you to stand tall. The path may twist, the climb may tire, but within your heart burns a steady fire — a flame of courage, unseen but true, waiting for the moment to carry you through.
    <b><i>So walk with hope, even when the road bends</i></b>; every storm that shakes you also mends. <b><i>Believe that time will heal and show</i></b>, that every loss helps you grow. <b><i>Keep faith in yourself when the world feels cold</i></b>, for your story is still being told — a story of strength, of dreams reborn, of rising again with every dawn.</p>
