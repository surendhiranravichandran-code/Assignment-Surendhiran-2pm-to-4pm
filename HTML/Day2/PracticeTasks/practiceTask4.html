    <h1>Q4:Add a &lt;hr&gt; between two paragraphs.</h1>
    <p>When life feels heavy and dreams seem far, remember that even the darkest night must end with the morning star. Every failure you face is not your fall, but a quiet whisper urging you to stand tall. The path may twist, the climb may tire, but within your heart burns a steady fire — a flame of courage, unseen but true, waiting for the moment to carry you through.<hr>So walk with hope, even when the road bends; every storm that shakes you also mends. Believe that time will heal and show, that every loss helps you grow. Keep faith in yourself when the world feels cold, for your story is still being told — a story of strength, of dreams reborn, of rising again with every dawn.</p>
