    <h1>Q3:Make a short poem using &lt;br&gt;for line breaks.</h1>
    <h2><b>Poem</b></h2>
   <p> The night feels long and cold,<br>
      And dreams seem faint, not bold,<br>
Remember — stars can’t shine so bright,<br>
Without the curtain of the night.<br><br>

Each step you take, though small, unsure,<br>
Is shaping paths that will endure.<br>
Mountains bow to those who climb,<br>
One breath, one hope, one rise at a time.<br><br>

So lift your heart, don’t count the scars,<br>
You’re made of strength, like silent stars.<br>
The storm will pass, the dawn will glow —<br>
Keep going on — just trust and grow.<br></p>
