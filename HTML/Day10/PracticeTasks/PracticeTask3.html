    <h2>Paragrah Style</h2>
    <p class="para-style">A well-designed website focuses on clarity, usability, and visual balance to create a smooth<br>
        experience for visitors. When content is organized with proper spacing, readable fonts, and consistent colors,<br>
        users can easily understand the information without feeling overwhelmed. Adding meaningful images, interactive,<br>
        elements, and structured sections helps guide the user through the page naturally. Whether it is a portfolio,<br>
        business site, or personal blog, thoughtful design ensures that every visitor can navigate with comfort and<br>
        confidence. As technology evolves, maintaining responsive layouts and clean code becomes even more important,<br>
        allowing the website to function beautifully across all devices and screen sizes.</p>
