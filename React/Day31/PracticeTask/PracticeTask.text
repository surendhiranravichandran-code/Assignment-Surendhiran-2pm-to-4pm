1.Define React in your own words?
Ans:
    React is a JavaScript library used for building fast and interactive user interfaces.
    It follows a component-based architecture, which helps in creating reusable UI components.
    React efficiently updates the UI using a virtual DOM, improving performance and making applications easier to maintain.
    It is mainly used for developing single-page applications and is maintained by Meta.

3.Identify entry file in React project?
Ans:
   The entry file is the file where the React application starts running and where the root component is rendered into the DOM.
   Here while using vite with react "main.jsx" creates the "root" and it renders app component.

5.Correct JSX syntax errors?
Ans:
    JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript.
    It is used in React to describe the UI structure of components.
    JSX is not HTML — it gets transformed into JavaScript by React (using Babel) before the browser can render it.
    It allows embedding JavaScript expressions inside {}.
